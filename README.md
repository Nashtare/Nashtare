My name's Robin and I currently work at [Toposware](https://www.toposware.com), where we are building the first zkEcosystem, where people can deploy sovereign execution layers and dApps with native interoperability by relying solely on cryptography!

There, I mostly work on crypto primitives and zero-knowledge proofs. On my free time, I also work on some open-source projects I like (still cryptography related), like [Winterfell](https://github.com/facebook/winterfell) or the [Anemoi project](https://github.com/anemoi-hash).

I'm always open to new collabs, either on a personal side for fun side projects or professionally through my company, so feel free to reach out if you think we could be a good fit!

And below, some stats because that's what Github is all about üòù

Oh and I also love taking pictures (mostly of nature and/or of Japan üáØüáµ, where I lived for 3 years). Here's a buddy I met in the city of Nara (Â•àËâØ):
