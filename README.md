My name's Robin and I currently work at [Polygon Labs](https://polygon.technology), following the acquisition of Toposware.

There, I mostly work on crypto primitives and zero-knowledge proofs. On my free time, I also work on some open-source projects I like (still cryptography related), like [Winterfell](https://github.com/facebook/winterfell) or the [Anemoi project](https://github.com/anemoi-hash), though building a zkEVM is time-consuming so I don't get to work on these side projects much these days ðŸ™ƒ

I'm always open to new collabs, either on a personal side for fun side projects or professionally through my company, so feel free to reach out if you think we could be a good fit!

Oh and I also love taking pictures. Here's a buddy I met in the city of Nara (å¥ˆè‰¯):
